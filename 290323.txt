 BYOD -[Bring Your Own Device]-
        BYOD (bring your own device) is a policy that allows employees in an organization

AAA -[Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting]-

    LOCAL AAA Authentication:
        Local AAA. Local AAA means that you are performing AAA without the use of an external database. 
        When performing local AAA, you can authenticate with a username and password 
        that is part of the configuration of the security appliance.
      
    SERVER-BASED AAA Authentication:
         An AAA server is a server program that handles user requests for access to computer resources and, 
         for an enterprise, provides authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) services. 
         Authentication is the process of identifying an individual, usually based on a username and password.
